# Project-Herald

This is a website for concerts (mostly classical) happening in Hungary. On the website one can browse concerts and get a basic description of those. If someone logs in they can add new concerts or modify existing ones.

## Run
Running the frontend (made in Angular):
1. navigate to the \frontend\project-herald folder.
2. run the Angular app with 'ng serve' to expose it on the default port. (Please make sure you have Angular installed on the machine.)
